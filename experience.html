				  <h1>Experience</h1>
          <p>I have built 2 complete games, as well as many smaller ones while working toward my degree. Working on these games taught me how to manage a project through the Scrum Agile framework. I utilized tools such as Trello and GitHub to effecively manage and maintain the development of our games.</p>
