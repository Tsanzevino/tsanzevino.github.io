					<h1>About the Project</h1>
					<p>Born from the annual GMTK Game Jam with the theme of "loop", Top G is a platform racer where your only opponent is yourself. Take the role of one of four different playable characters, each with their own unique ability, with as many split-screen friends as you can get together in order to sprint through the city to get the best lap time you can.</p>
					<p>Engage with the track in different ways as your top speed rises through collecting power-ups as you run by, allowing you to take new shortcuts while avoiding obstacles. Hold on to that speed until you eventually lose control and have no time to spare. Mastery over the game's mechanics can lead you towards flying at ludicrous speeds, obtaining lap times others can only ever dream of.</p>
					<h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
					<p>This project was built together with my best friend and fellow Game Developer, <a href="https://connnand.github.io/index.html">Connor Adkins</a>. Having much more experience in Game Jams than I, he guided me through my first Jam and taught me the essentials for rapid development. I learned how to iterate upon ideas quickly, with constant prototyping and playtesting.</p>
					<p>I learned the strengths of working together with a partner very early, as we were always bouncing ideas back and forth. Any issues that cropped up were easily solved either through communication or collaboration. There was always something to build, yet it never felt overwhelming. By limiting the scope of the project, we were able to refine the core gameplay enough to spruce things up and make the game look and feel like a game.</p>
